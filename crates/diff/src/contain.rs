//! Does a local file already contain the changes the head made since the pusher's base?
//! (ticket 17, ADR 0002). `push` runs [`contains_changes`] when the Sidecar's `base_version` is
//! behind the head; the server re-runs it on commit. annotary never merges: the Member or agent
//! merges with their own tools (git, by hand, applying the printed diff) and this only checks the
//! result.
//!
//! **Algorithm** — a line-level 3-way comparison: the histogram line diffs base→head and
//! base→local (the same line diff re-anchoring uses) are grouped into chunks of overlapping
//! changes over the base. Every chunk the head changed is judged on its own:
//! - local's text for the chunk == head's ⇒ contained;
//! - local did not touch the chunk (its text is the base's) ⇒ **missing**;
//! - both changed it, differently ⇒ the same comparison again inside the chunk at **word-token**
//!   level (UAX #29 tokens, as re-anchoring uses): contained iff every token chunk the head
//!   changed reads the same in local (two edits to different sentences of one line, or a merged
//!   sentence plus an edit elsewhere on the line); otherwise missing.
//!
//! Two changes overlap when their base ranges intersect, or when one of them is a pure insertion
//! or deletion touching the other (where an insertion lands next to an edit is ambiguous, so the
//! two are judged together); two pure insertions at one point are contained when the head's is a
//! run inside local's (both appended a section). Next to another edit, or among repeated lines,
//! two diffs of the same base can place one change differently, so the comparison is repeated
//! under a few alignments (`Align`) and the change counts as contained when any of them shows
//! it — each is sound on its own (local must read exactly like the head in an aligned region), so
//! the retries only remove false refusals. What remains refused without being a real conflict are
//! edits separated only by blank or repeated lines whose alignment no diff gets right — the safe
//! direction (ADR 0002; `--discard-head-changes` is the escape). Missing changes are reported as
//! base→head unified-diff hunks with up to [`CONTEXT`] lines of context and the head's line
//! numbers on the `+` side.
//!
//! Pure function of three texts: no time limits, no randomness, CRLF tolerated and a final newline
//! ignored ([`annotary_sidecar::range::lines`] semantics). Oversized token hunks use the same
//! bounded fallback as the mapping ([`crate::mapping::MAX_HUNK_TOKENS`]).
//!
//! Assets are compared by manifest, not by text: [`missing_asset_changes`].
