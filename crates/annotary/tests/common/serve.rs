//! `ServeGuard`: a spawned `annotary serve` that never outlives its test (CMD-28).
//!
//! `std::process::Child` is not killed on drop, so a test that panics between spawning `serve`
//! and stopping it leaves the server running (holding a deleted temp store and a port) long
//! after the test binary exits. Every test that spawns a real `serve` wraps the child in a
//! `ServeGuard` immediately. On drop it sends SIGTERM, waits up to [`GRACE`], then SIGKILLs, and
//! always reaps the child. Stopping the server on purpose (SIGTERM, SIGKILL) goes through the
//! guard as well.
