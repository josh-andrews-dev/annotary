//! `--help` texts (ticket 14): the CLI prototype's hand-written help, word for word where the
//! shipped flags agree and adjusted where later tickets changed one, as clap `help_template`s.
//!
//! Why templates rather than clap's generated help: the prototype groups the verbs by area
//! (Documents / Threads / Actions / Wait / Local server / Members & credentials), lists the
//! global options once, and documents output shapes and exit codes — none of which clap's
//! per-command layout can express — and the top-level help is the agent's on-demand reference
//! (spec story 149, ≈ 700 tokens), so its token cost is part of the contract. Usage errors keep
//! clap's generated `Usage:` line (a template only changes `--help`). Verbs the prototype did not
//! write help for keep clap's generated help.
//!
//! Keep in step: `tests::every_flag_is_documented` fails when a verb gains a flag its template
//! does not mention, and `{name,...}`-shaped examples must not nest braces (clap reads `{…}` as a
//! template tag; a tag it does not know is printed back verbatim, but a `{` without a `}` before
//! the next `{` is dropped).

/// `annotary --help` / `-h` (≈ 700 tokens, o200k).

  -p, --profile NAME          Who you are: a profile in ~/.annotary/config.toml (no default;
                              else ANNOTARY_TOKEN, then ANNOTARY_PROFILE)
      --json [FIELDS]         JSON output; FIELDS narrows (comma list), '?' lists fields

DOC is a Document id (k7q2m9xd), a Name unique in the Vault (plan), or a path to a pulled file (./plan.md).
Every line number printed is stamped with its Version (v4:16). Quote Thread id + text, not line numbers.
Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 usage · 2 not found/ambiguous · 3 no credential · 4 missing right ·
            5 conflict/refused · 6 server unreachable · 7 wait timed out
";

pub const PUSH: &str = "\
Upload a Version. The heavy verb by design: hashes, scans assets, records image/video dimensions,
converts HEIC/AVIF/TIFF/BMP to web derivatives, re-anchors every Thread, renders HTML — then commits.

Usage: annotary push FILE.md [options]

  -m, --message MSG        Version message
      --doc DOC            Bind this file to an existing Document (writes the Sidecar); default:
                           Sidecar beside FILE.md, else create a new Document. DOC = id | unique Name |
                           path to a pulled .md
      --vault NAME         Vault for a new Document (default: Sidecar → --vault → profile → error if >1)
      --strict             Warnings are errors: missing/unsupported assets, absolute paths, depth > 5,
                           no web derivative
      --force              Push even if the Sidecar is from another Document id (rebinds it to --doc)
      --discard-head-changes  Push over the changes the head made since your pull (warns; logged)

Prints one line: `NAME  ID  vN` (or `vN (same content as vK)` / `already vN` when nothing changed);
on a TTY the web URL follows. Progress and warnings go to stderr (`assets: …`, `threads: … re-anchored`).
`--json` → {name,id,version,same_as?,already?,warnings[]} (+ assets, threads, vault, hash, url).

Warnings (stderr, exit 0 unless --strict):
  missing asset      referenced file not found — pushed with missing:true
  unsupported asset  type not in the supported list — left as written
  absolute path      file:// or absolute reference — ignored
  depth              linked .md deeper than 5 — ignored
  derivative         HEIC/HEIF/AVIF needs macOS `sips` or ImageMagick — original pushed without one

Head moved since your pull (Sidecar base_version < head): your file must already contain the head's
changes — merge them in git or by hand. If it does, the push is normal. If not: exit 5 and the
missing changes as a unified diff on stderr (`--json`: missing[], assets[]); put them in, push again.
A .annotary left with git conflict markers needs no resolving.
";

pub const PULL: &str = "\
Usage: annotary pull DOC [options]

      --version N          Pull Version N (writes N's Name; Threads as they were on N)
      --assets             Also write Assets to their relative paths (off by default)
      --force              Overwrite local edits / differing Asset files
      --out DIR            Directory to write into (default: .)

Writes exactly two files: <name>.md (byte-identical) and <name>.annotary (JSON projection).
Prints `NAME.md  NAME.annotary  vN`; the `N threads, M assets (K missing)` summary goes to stderr.
Refuses if <name>.md exists and differs from the last pulled/pushed hash — exit 5 — unless --force.
Agents: do not read the .annotary file; use `show`, `thread list`, `status`.
";

pub const THREAD: &str = "\
Usage: annotary thread <cmd> DOC [ID] [options]

  list DOC                 Open Threads on head, document order, orphaned last (one per line)
      --all                Include resolved
      --resolved           Only resolved
      --status S           anchored | refined | orphaned (comma list)
      --mentions-me        Only Threads that mention you (root or reply)
      --since T            Created or replied since: 2h, 3d, 2026-08-17, 2026-08-17T10:00Z
      --sort recent        Most recent activity first (default: document order)
      --version N          Threads as they were on Version N (read-only time-slice)
  show DOC ID...           Everything on one or more Threads (t2 t7)
  new DOC ANCHOR -m MSG    ANCHOR = \"L:C-L:C\" on head, or --document, or --asset REF (img/x.png)
                           A range must match head; the CLI checks the text before posting.
      --version N          Assert head is N (exit 5 if not) — never comment on content you haven't seen
  reply DOC ID -m MSG      Reply; MSG may be '-' for stdin
      --resolve            …and resolve in the same call
  resolve DOC ID | reopen DOC ID
  edit DOC ID -m MSG       Your own Comment (owner: anyone's) — sets edited; ID = t7 or t7.1
  delete DOC ID            Tombstone a Comment (t7 or t7.1) — the Thread and ids stay

List columns: ID  AUTHOR  ANCHOR  BODY  REPLIES  AGE
  ANCHOR = vN:L \"exact quote\"          — anchored (word omitted)
           vN:L refined \"exact quote\"  — text under it changed; `show` prints the current text
           vN:L orphaned \"exact quote\" — span gone (vN:L is its last valid placement)
           document | asset REF
Body is the root Comment, first 120 chars, newlines collapsed. `--json` for full bodies.
Bodies are Markdown, no embeds. 100,000-char cap per Document (exit 5 with the count when hit).
";

pub const WAIT: &str = "\
Block until something happens, print it, exit 0. Cheap for agents: one long-poll, no polling loop.

Usage: annotary wait [DOC] [options]

      --on KINDS           version,action,mention (default) — also thread,reply,resolve,reopen
      --action ID          With action: only this Action id
      --cursor SEQ         Resume from an event cursor (from `status` or a previous `wait`)
      --timeout DUR        Give up after DUR (default 30m; 0 = never) — exit 7
      --json               One JSON object per event line

Output: SEQ  KIND  DOC  DETAIL   (one line per event; all events that arrived together are printed)
  814  version  plan  v5 by @rowan \"address review\"
  815  action   plan  approve v5 by @rowan
  816  mention  plan  t2.2 by @rowan \"…@scribe…\"
Without DOC: every Document you can read. Survives server restarts (cursor is durable).
Timeout: `wait: nothing after DUR (seq N)` on stderr, exit 7 — resume with --cursor N.
";

pub const STATUS: &str = "\
Usage: annotary status DOC [--deleted]

One line: NAME  ID  vN  action:ID@vN by @handle | -  open:N  mentions-me:N  seq:N
`--json` → {name,id,version,action,open_threads,mentions_me,seq} — action = {id,by,at} or omitted.
Cheapest read there is. `seq` is the cursor for `wait --cursor`. --deleted also reads a deleted Document.
";

pub const ACT: &str = "\
Usage: annotary act DOC ACTION [--version N]

ACTION is an id from the Document's available set (`show DOC` lists them). Actions are per-Version and
head-only: `--version N` refuses (exit 5) if head ≠ N. Last Action on a Version wins. No note field —
say why in a Thread. Needs the `action` right on the Vault.
Prints `NAME  vN  ACTION  by @handle`; `--json` → {name,id,version,action,by,at}.
";

pub const MEMBER: &str = "\
Usage: annotary member <cmd>  (owner only; `list` for everyone)

  add HANDLE [--name \"Display Name\"]
        One step: Member + Membership + grant * (read,comment,action,write) + token, printed once.
        This is how you add anyone: a person or an agent.
  list                     handle  name  role  grants  (disabled)
  rename HANDLE NEW        Changes the display name; the handle itself never changes
  disable HANDLE           Keeps history; token stops working
  grant HANDLE VAULT|* RIGHTS   e.g. grant linter notes read,comment — `none` removes the grant
  role HANDLE owner|member
";

pub const DAEMON: &str = "\
Usage: annotary daemon install | uninstall | status | start | stop | restart

  install [--port N]       Write the LaunchAgent (RunAtLoad, KeepAlive, log → logs/server.log) and start it;
                           first-run setup if the store is empty
      [--bind ADDR --allow-remote] [--url URL] [--link-base URL]
                           Passed to `serve` in the plist: reachable from your phone (Tailscale / LAN
                           address), the public URL and the link relay — see `serve --help`
  uninstall                Stop it and remove the plist (the data dir stays)
  status                   running / pid / since / URL / store / log — from server.json (a stale pid
                           reads as not running)
  start | stop             Load / unload the LaunchAgent (stop keeps it installed; start or the next login
                           brings it back)
  restart                  Restart the running server (upgrade = replace the binary, then `daemon restart`)

macOS: writes ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.annotary.server.plist running `annotary serve`
with the current data dir; `status` reads ~/.annotary/server.json. Other platforms: exit 1 with
\"unsupported — run `annotary serve` under your service manager\".
";

pub const LINK: &str = "\
Usage: annotary link DOC [tN]

Prints the URL a person opens to look at DOC — at Thread tN when given — on another device: the
server's public URL (`serve --url`), through the link relay when one is set (`serve --link-base`:
it opens the iOS app where installed, the web page elsewhere). No public URL set: this CLI's server
URL plus a note on stderr. `--json` → {url,name,id} (+ thread, public).
Agents: give a person this link when you want them to look at something.
";

pub const PAIR: &str = "\
Usage: annotary pair [--member HANDLE] [--name NAME]

      --member HANDLE      Pair a device for another Member (owner only); default: yourself
      --name NAME          The new Token's name (default: device)

Mints a Token and prints it as a annotary://pair URL — on a TTY also as a QR code to scan with
the iPhone or iPad camera or Annotary. Shown once; `token revoke ID` revokes it.
Non-TTY: PAIR_URL  MEMBER  TOKEN_ID  NAME. `--json` → {pair_url,member,token_id,name} (+ server,
profile, token). Needs a public URL (`serve --url http://HOST:PORT`): exit 5 without one.
";

pub const SKILL: &str = "\
Usage: annotary skill install [--dir DIR] [--force]

Writes this binary's embedded SKILL.md — the agent skill: rules, command table, exit codes, ≤ 60
lines — to DIR/annotary/SKILL.md and prints the path. DIR defaults to ./.agents/skills (the
cross-harness location); e.g. --dir ~/.claude/skills. An identical file is left alone; a differing
one (older version, local edit) is refused without --force (exit 5).
The skill's metadata.version is this CLI's version: when `annotary --version` differs, run
`skill install` again — the skill itself says so. There is no references file: `annotary
<command> --help` is the reference.
