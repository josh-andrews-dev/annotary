# Implementation notes

What each area's code is, where it lives and the decisions to keep, written by the agents that
built it, ticket by ticket. These were the root `CLAUDE.md` until 2026-10-18; they moved here so a
session loads only `AGENTS.md` and reads the file for the area it is about to touch. Each file is
"extend, don't rewrite": a change to an area updates its file in the same pull request.

The spec is [`../phase1/spec.md`](../phase1/spec.md). "Ticket N" and `CMD-n` in these notes are labels
from the project's build history and its old tracker; the items themselves are not public. New work is
filed in GitHub Issues.
